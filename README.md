## Documentation

For developing this project, I prepared one basic design documentation. I will encourage you to see that first, so that you can get a better idea what to expect from this.

- [Design Document - Link](https://viewer.diagrams.net/?tags=%7B%7D&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Acko%20Weather%20Design%20Document#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1LDoDDeXxr86frGwT0wGW1eg2tLLtGAFS%26export%3Ddownload)

## Demo

- [Live Version - Github Actions - CI/CD](https://iamsomraj.github.io/React-Acko-Weather-App/)

- Installing Into Local System is Preferred

## Install React-Acko-Weather-App On Your Local System

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- Bun (optional, for faster package management) or npm/yarn

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamsomraj/React-Acko-Weather-App.git
cd React-Acko-Weather-App
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Using Bun (recommended for faster installation):

```bash
bun install
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit the `.env` file and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:

   ```bash
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

   To get your API key:
   - Visit [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Navigate to API keys section
   - Copy your API key and replace `your_actual_api_key_here` in the `.env` file

## Run React-Acko-Weather-App

### Development Mode

Using Bun:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default port).

### Production Build

```bash
bun run build
# or
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
bun run preview
# or
npm run preview
```

## Running Tests

The project uses Vitest for testing with React Testing Library. Multiple test commands are available:

### Run Tests Once

```bash
bun run test
# or
npm run test
```

### Watch Mode (for development)

```bash
bun run test:watch
# or
npm run test:watch
```

### Test UI (interactive testing interface)

```bash
bun run test:ui
# or
npm run test:ui
```

### Code Quality

Run linting:

```bash
bun run lint
# or
npm run lint
```

Fix linting issues:

```bash
bun run lint:fix
# or
npm run lint:fix
```

Format code:

```bash
bun run format
# or
npm run format
```

## How To Test 2 Different Modes of Application

React-Acko-Weather-App currently has 2 modes of operation.

- Geolocation Mode : Fetches forecast data based on position
- User Input Mode : Fetches forecast data based on city name

After installing it into your local system, you can enable or disable Location permission for the website and refresh. At the time of doing, you should be on the [Home Page](http://localhost:5173/).

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment

```bash
bun run deploy
# or
npm run deploy
```

This will build the project and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

## FAQ

**Question:** Why have you used Typescript?

**Answer:** Nowadays, most React applications are built using Typescript. That's why, I have used it. Also, I like the language and it gives many benefits in the long run. I think, in future, everyone will develop React applications using only Typescript.

**Question:** Why have you used Redux?

**Answer:** It helps to keep the Main logic of the application separate with the rest of the application. One can also use React hooks, i.e., `useReducer`. But, my personal preference is Redux. In small parts of application, I also have used React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`.

**Question:** There are very few unit tests. Why?

**Answer:** I also agree to this. I am not very comfortable with unit tests. That's why, I was finding it difficult to write those tests. Still, for this assignment, I have tried my best to learn `react-testing-library` and implement all the things. I feel, If I give proper effort, then, it will definitely help me regarding this.

**Question:** Why have not you used Docker Hub as mentioned in the mail?

**Answer:** I have very little knowledge about Docker. Also, I have not used it, myself. In this time span, I wanted to focus on the application functionality itself.

**Question:** Why have you chosen this specific `5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast` API
from [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)?

**Answer:** There are only 3 free API options available on Open Weather Map API for Current & Forecast weather data collection. They are the following:

- Current Weather Data
- One Call API
- 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast `( only this fulfilled the assignment requirment )`
