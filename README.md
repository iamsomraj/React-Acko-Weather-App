## FAQ

**Question:** Why have you used Typescript?

**Answer:** Nowadays, most React applications are built using Typescript. That's why, I have used it. Also, I like the language and it gives many benefits in the long run. I think, in future, everyone will develop React applications using only Typescript.

**Question:** Why have you used Redux?

**Answer:** It helps to keep the Main logic of the application separate with the rest of the application. One can also use React hooks, i.e., `useReducer`. But, my personal preference is Redux. In small parts of application, I also have used React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`.

**Question:** There are very few unit tests. Why?

**Answer:** I also agree to this. I am not very comfortable with unit tests. That's why, I was finding it difficult to write those tests. Still, for this assignment, I have tried my best to learn `react-testing-library` and implement all the things. I feel, If I give proper effort, then, it will definitely help me regarding this.

**Question:** Why have not you used Docker Hub as mentioned in the mail?

**Answer:** I have very little knowledge about Docker. Also, I have not used it, myself. In this time span, I wanted to focus on the application functionality itself.

**Question:** Why have you chosen this specific `5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast` API
 from [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)?

**Answer:** There are only 3 free API options available on Open Weather Map API for Current & Forecast weather data collection. They are the following:
- Current Weather Data
- One Call API
- 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast `( only this fulfilled the assignment requirment )`
